# The following comments fill some of the gaps in Solargraph's understanding of
# Rails apps. Since they're all in YARD, they get mapped in Solargraph but
# ignored at runtime.

# You can put this file anywhere in the project, as long as it gets included in
# the workspace maps. It's recommended that you keep it in a standalone file
# instead of pasting it into an existing one.
